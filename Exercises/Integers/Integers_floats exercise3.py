#But be aware that you can sometimes get an arbitrary number of decimal
#places in your answer: 0.30000000000000004 & 0.30000000000000004
#This happens in all languages and is of little concern. Python tries to
#find a way to represent the result as precisely as possible, which is sometimes
#difficult given how computers have to represent numbers internally. Just
#ignore the extra decimal places for now; youâ€™ll learn ways to deal with the
#extra places when you need to in the projects in Part II.
