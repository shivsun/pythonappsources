#Accessing Elements in a List
#Lists are ordered collections, so you can access any element in a list by
#telling Python the position, or index, of the item desired. To access an element
#in a list, write the name of the list followed by the index of the item
#enclosed in square brackets.
#For example, letâ€™s pull out the first bicycle in the list bicycles:

bikes = ["Royal Enfield", "Rajdoot", "Bajaj Chetak", "TVS Super"]

print (bikes[3])
